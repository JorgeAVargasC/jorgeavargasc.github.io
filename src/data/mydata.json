Coming from a family of musicians, I consider the interpretation of the piano and music excellent activities that my parents have left me, having given me the opportunity to play in his orchestra along with well-known artists of the genre. These activities have allowed me to get out of the routine, and have helped me to improve my performance as an engineer and web developer."
